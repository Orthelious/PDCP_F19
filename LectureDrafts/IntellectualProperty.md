# Intellectual Property 
### _...Or Making, Taking, Hacking, Modding, Sharing, Altering, Integrating, Stealing, Borrowing, Lending, Remixing, Buying, Selling or Doing Someone A Solid... With The Things That You Create._

As creative practitioners, we all participate in the act of intellectual property creation. Whether that’s for our own personal work, as part of our professional practice, or in service to an employer or client. But what is intellectual property? In this unit we will define the legal definitions of IP, the rights that you have, and IP protections such as patent, copyright, trademark, etc. From there, we will discuss how to share and monetize IP as a method for generating value. We will also explore the ways in which we can change, alter, rip, pirate, destroy, remix and recreate the work of others as a part of our creative process.

**Chapters**
1. Introduction to Intellectual Property
1. IP Protections and Artists Rights
1. Licensing and Royalties
1. Permissions, Derivatives, and Fair Use

## Chapter One: Introduction to Intellectual Property
In brief, this chapter is a primer on what constitutes **intellectual property**, what rights you have, and how to use IP laws and regulations to your advantage to protect, create, remix, transform, and share your work.

**_Three topics in this chapter:_**  
A. Defining Intellectual Property  
B. The Big Three in IP: Patent, Copyright, Trademark  
C. Why it's important to understand IP  

### A. Defining Intellectual Property
#### — WHAT IS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

*» From Merriam-Webster*
> Intellectual Property : property (such as an idea, invention, or process) that
derives from the work of the mind or intellect; also : an application, right, or
registration relating to this

*» A simple definition:*

* The result (work or invention) of creativity.

*» IP also refers to:*

* The rights, priorities and privileges of your work.
* The categories of laws and regulations that prevent unauthorized use by
others.

Much like physical property, IP can be created, owned, traded, destroyed, transferred, stolen, borrowed, etc. The key distinction here is that it is property that is generated of the intellect...

![Tim & Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! Episode 3 of season 4](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/tim-and-eric-mind-blown.gif)

...and thus needs it's own set of rules, guidelines, and regulations. IP helps define all of the ideas, processes, and plans closely tied with a piece of property, but that can be separated from the property itself. 

#### — THE ORIGIN OF IP
I'm going to totally pull the laziness card and just play this section of the video essay "Everything is a Remix" by Kirby Ferguson. 

[![everything is a remix](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/b1_remix.png)](https://youtu.be/nJPERZDfyWc?t=1459)

*Disclaimer: I don't entirely endorse with the position the author makes towards the end of the video.*



## // The Big Three in IP: Patent, Copyright, Trademark
There are a number of smaller, specific categories of IP in US law ([like plant species!](https://www.wipo.int/sme/en/documents/upov_plant_variety_fulltext.html)) For the purposes of this course, we're going to discuss the three major categories of IP:

* **Patents** — Protects specific inventions and related processes.

* **Copyrights** — Protects “original works of authorship.”

* **Trademark** — Protects names, phrases and symbols used in commerce.

*We will go over each of these in much greater detail in [B.2]*

### — Patents
*» What do they protect?*

* Processes, methods and inventions that are “novel,” “non-obvious,” and
“useful.”
* A patent cannot protect a idea on its own. The idea must be part of
something recognizable and distinct.
* Patents can apply to: processes and methods; a manufactured article
(object); a new composition (of matter); an asexually and new variety of
plant.

### — Copyrights

*» What do they protect?*

* “Original works of authorship.”
* Which include: literary works; musical works, including any accompanying
words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimes
and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; motion
pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; architectural works;
computer programs (sometimes the graphical user interface) and websites.
* Ideas and concepts **on their own** do not have copyright   
	*[Why would this be true?]*
	
### — Trademarks

*» What do they protect?*

* Names, phrases, images that represent a product and distinguish it in
commerce.
* Includes Trade Dress (visual appearance of a product) and Service Marks
(Identifies a service as opposed to a product.)
* Basically, trademarks protect brands.

## // Why it's important to understand IP

***Your practice will be more successful if you understand:***

* The difference between the IP that you do and do not own.
* How to utilize the IP of others.
* How you can protect your work.
* How you can defend yourself and your work.

# [B.2] IP Protections and Artists Rights

*Four sections to this topic*

1. Patents
2. Trademarks
3. Copyrights
4. The Visual Artists Rights Act

In B.1 we covered the high level basics of the three primary types of IP protections: Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights. In this lecture we will cover the process of how to obtain each of these protections and delve into what specifically each IP type protects. 

*» Relevant IP-related items we will cover in future units include:*

* How to take legal action.
* Takedown notices and cease-and-desist letters.
* Specific IP laws like the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
* Pricing and structures for licenses 
* Contract elements

Additionally, this unit will touch on the visual artist specific Visual Artist Rights Act. 

*» A few notes*

* IP protections ≠ Prerequisites to creation
* Correct answers ≠ Right answers
* This lecture specifically covers United States law. 
* I am not a lawyer. Take what I say with a grain of salt. I’m more like a... swimming pool lifeguard.

## // Patent
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/b2_bailey.png)  
[Parody Patent Drawings Highlight Silicon Valley Greed · Vice
](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/4xq5qj/fake-patent-drawings-electronic-superhighway)

*» Our quick definition*
>**Patents** — Protects specific inventions and related processes.

### — Key Government Agency
[United States Patent and Trademark Office
](https://www.uspto.gov/)
### — What is a Patent?

* A patent for an invention is the grant of a property right to the inventor,
issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
* US patents only apply within the United States and US territories.
* Patents grant the right to exclude others from making, using, offering for
sale, or selling” the invention in the United States or “importing” the
invention into the United States.
	* A Patent is not a right to **make**, but a right to **exclude**.

### — What patents protect 

* Processes, methods and inventions that are “novel,” “non-obvious,” and
“useful.”
* A patent cannot protect a idea on its own. The idea must be part of
something recognizable and distinct.
* Patents can apply to: processes and methods; a manufactured article
(object); a new composition (of matter); an asexually and new variety of
plant.

### — Types of Patents
1. **Utility Patents** — invention or discovery of any new and useful
process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter, or
any new and useful improvement thereof.
2. **Design Patents** — Granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and
ornamental design for an article of manufacture
3. **Plant patents** — Granted to anyone who invents or discovers and
asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant.

### — Time-restrictions for Patents  

* The term of a patent is 20 years.
* Under certain circumstances this can be extended.

### — The Patent Process

1. Determine if your invention is patentable (Novel, Non-Obvious and Useful).
2. Conduct a search for prior patents or public disclosures (i.e. Has it already
been patented by someone else?)
3. Determine the type of patent you need (Utility, Design, or Plant)
4. File an application with the US Patent and Trademark Office and pay the
fee. (A patent lawyer is strongly encouraged)
5. Work with an examiner, who will review patent application. (USPTO)
6. If approved, maintain your patent (There are maintenance fees)

## // Trademark

[Artist Imagines How McDonalds Would Look If Nazis Opened It In Hell · Bored Panda](https://www.boredpanda.com/evil-mcdonalds-nazi-hell-jake-dinos-chapman)

*» Our quick definition*  
>**Trademark** — Protects names, phrases and symbols used in commerce.

### — Key Government Agency
[United States Patent and Trademark Office
](https://www.uspto.gov/)

### — What is a trademark (or service mark)?
* A trademark is generally a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a
combination thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the
goods of one party from those of others.
* A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and
distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods.

### — What Trademarks Protect
* Names, phrases, images that represent a product and distinguish it in
commerce.
* Basically, trademarks protect brand.

### — The Trademark process
* Similar to the Patent Process, you must register trademarks through the US
Patent and Trademark Office.
* The most important part of applying for a Trademark is the consideration
step. Consideration refers to determining if the mark:
	* Is a “strong” or “weak” mark
	* Is likely to be confused with other marks
	* Similarity to other marks
	* and many more!

[Monkey does not own selfie copyright, appeals court rules · CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/24/us/monkey-selfie-peta-appeal/index.html)

*» Our quick definition*  
>**Copyrights** — Protects “original works of authorship.”

### — Key Government Agency
[U.S. Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)

### — What does a copyright protect?
* “Original works of authorship.”
* Which include: literary works; musical works, including any accompanying
words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; pantomimes
and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic and sculptural works; motion
pictures and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; architectural works;
computer programs (sometimes the graphical user interface) and websites.
* Ideas and concepts on their own do not have copyright protection.

### — What are the rights of a copyright owner?
* Reproduce the work in copies.
* Prepare derivative works based upon the work.
* Distribute copies of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or
by rental, lease, or lending.
* Perform the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work;
a pantomime; or a motion picture or other audiovisual work.
* Display the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; a
pantomime; or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work. This right also applies to the
individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.
* Perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission if the work is a
sound recording.

### — What is not covered by a copyright?
* Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, or
discoveries
* Works that are not fixed in a tangible form (such as a choreographic work
that has not been notated or recorded or an improvisational speech that
has not been written down)
* Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans
* Familiar symbols or designs
* Mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring
* Mere listings of ingredients or contents

### — Who can claim copyright?
* The author(s) of the work.
* For joint authors:
	* If works are combined into a single work, joint authors share **equal
ownership**.
	* If authors contribute to a collective work, each author retains the right
to **their individual contribution**. 
* [Works-for-hire ](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf) (i.e. parties that pay for the work to be made)

	*Two types of work-for-hire to be aware of:*
	* A work prepared by an employee within the scope of [their] employment 
	* A work specially ordered or commissioned for use  

### — How do I create a copyright for my work?
* Surprise! Copyright exists automatically in an original, finished work.
* The work must be in a **fixed, tangible medium**.

*Then why would copyright registration exist?*
* Copyright registration **enhances** your already existing rights.

**» Reasons to register:**

* To bring a copyright infringement case to court, your work must be
registered.
* To sue for statutory damages ($$$), your work must be registered.
* You can only sue for the attorney’s fees and costs of litigation if your work is
registered.

**» How to register:**

* Complete a filing form with the US Copyright Office.
* Give them a non-refundable filing fee.
* Send in copies of the work (i.e. samples, photos, etc.)

### — Term of a Copyright
* For an individual: Life of the author + 70 years
* For works-for-hire: 95 years from publication or 120 years
from creations. Whichever is shorter.
* Copyrights, like physical property, and can be inherited or transferred, but this
doesn’t restart the clock on the term of the copyright.

## // The Visual Artists Rights Act
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/b2_tiltedarc.jpg)  
[VARA was enacted in the wake of the "Tilted Arc" controversy of 1990.](https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-why-the-visual-artists-rights-act-is-failing-to-protect-street-art-and-murals) 

### — What is VARA?
* A 1990 Act of Congress granting additional protections specifically for
categories of visual art.
* Before this act, artists in the United States had virtually no power to protect
their work from mutilation, misattribution, or destruction.
* VARA assigns “Moral Rights” in addition to Copyrights.

### — VARA Moral Rights:
* **Disclosure or divulgation**, which allows the artist to determine when a
work is complete and may be displayed.
* **Paternity or attribution**, which allows an artist to protect the identification
of their name with their own work, and to disclaim it when applied to
another’s.
* **The right of withdrawal**, which permits the artist to modify or withdraw a
work following publication.
* **Integrity**, which allows the artist to prevent their work from being displayed
in an altered, distorted, or mutilated form.

### — What kind of art does VARA cover?
* Very limited categories of fine art.
* VARA covers: Paintings, sculptures, drawings, prints, still photographs produced for exhibition.
* Within this group, only single copies or signed and numbered limited editions of 200 or less are
actually protected.

### — How long does VARA last?
* The lifetime of the author.
* For multiple authors, on the the death of the last author.

### — Fun loophole!
* Under VARA (unlike copyright infringement), an artist has a cause of action in a federal court
even if their artwork is not registered with the Copyright Office.

# [B.3] Licensing and Royalties

Three sections in this lecture: 

1. [Licenses](#lic)
2. [Royalties](#roy)
3. [Elements of an licensing and royalty agreement](#ele)

## <a name="lic">Licenses</a>
### Quick Definition

>**License** — A grant by the holder of a copyright or patent to another of any of the rights embodied in the copyright or patent short of an assignment of all rights. [[Source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/license)

### What is a license?

* Licenses are basically ‘permissions for use.’
* Licenses are a **type of agreement** 
* Based on the concept of **divisibility**.
	* The Copyright Act of 1976 allows copyright holders to grant narrowly defined licenses (i.e. permissions) dividing up the rights of their copyrighted works.
* Think of this as granting a ‘limited copyright’ to someone else.
* Licenses can apply to Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks.

Source: ["Licensing Your Art" · artbusinessnews.com](http://artbusinessnews.com/2015/10/licensing-your-art/)

### Rights a license can grant‡
* Reproduce the work in copies.
* Prepare derivative works based upon the work.
* Distribute copies of the work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership or
by rental, lease, or lending.
* Perform the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work;
a pantomime; or a motion picture or other audiovisual work.
* Display the work publicly if it is a literary, musical, dramatic, or choreographic work; a pantomime; or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work. This right also applies to the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work.
* Perform the work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission if the work is a sound recording.

***‡Look familiar? It's the same as the rights that are conferred by trademarks, copyrights and patents.***


## <a name="roy">Royalties</a>
### Quick Definition:
>**Royalty** — A payment to an author or composer for each copy of a work sold or to an inventor for each item sold under a patent.

##### — What is the difference between a royalty and a license?

* License = The permission
* Royalty = The payment

A license grants permission to use the IP. The royalty is the payment for that use.

##### — A few examples of types of royalty rates:

* **Per Unit**— You receive a percentage of the sale of each unit. 
	
	For example, the percentage a musician receives each time their song plays on spotify.

* **Net Sales** — You receive a percentage of total sales. 
	
	For example, your agent sells hundreds of your prints of all different sizes. Rather than assign a different, unique percentage per artwork, you agree to a 10% take of the final sales total.  

* **Guaranteed Minimum** — Regardless if the merchandise sells or not, you are paid a guaranteed minimum payment. 

	For example, you license a photo to be reproduced on bucket hats with a guaranteed minimum of $100. Then bucket hats go out of fashion and the company can't sell any—you will receive your minimum regardless. 

* *And many many more.*

##### **~A NOTE~**
Please remember that these are *just* starting points. Things get complex when you start examining how licenses and royalties apply across different creative practices. 

*For example:*
[Ending a Seven-Year Dispute, a US Court Rules That Artists Aren’t Entitled to Royalties for Artworks Resold at Auction · ArtNet
](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/us-appeals-court-strikes-royalties-law-1314857)

## <a name="ele">Elements of a license and royalty agreement</a>

##### — License and royalty agreements acutally protect *both parties*

* The licensor (IP owner) has their copyright protected from misuse and is paid for the use of their IP
* The licensee (Buyer) is protected from claims of improper use by the licensor, as the terms for use are spelled out in the agreement. 

##### — Elements of a licensing and royalty agreement: 
* **Purpose of license** — Which of your copyright(s) are you granting them? (For example: allowing someone to create derivative works.)
* **Scope and Limitations of Use** — What limits are place on the use? Is it a one-time use for a specific reproduction? Is it a world-wide license? Are there limitations to how many copies or reproductions?
* **Term** — Time period of the license. Is it a one-time license? Perpetual?
* **Consideration** — Flat fee? Royalty (percentage of sales)? A combination? How will you get paid and how often?
* **Exclusivity** — Is this an exclusive or non-exclusive license?
* **Attribution and Display** — How will you be credited? How will the work be displayed?
* **Termination** (We’ll cover this in the Contracts Unit)
* **Indemnification** (We’ll cover this in the Contracts Unit)
* **Arbitration** (We’ll cover this in the Contracts Unit)

# [B.4] Permissions, Derivatives, and Fair Use

Sections in this lecture:

1. Transference
2. Derivative Works
3. Open Source and Public Licenses
4. Fair Use
5. The Public Domain

## Transference
*A quick definition:*
>**Transfer** — The act of assigning the rights to a piece of intellectual property belonging to one party, through written instrument, to another party. 

What is transference?

* The act of giving your full IP rights away to another party.
	* The rights to Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks can all be transferred to another party.
* This should be done via a written, legal agreement.
* This is common in Work-For-Hire agreements. When the contract is complete, the IP is transferred over to the principal. 
* Moral rights (VARA), however, cannot be transferred, *but they may be waived.*


## Derivative Works
*A quick definition:*
>Derivative Work — A derivative work is a new, original product that includes aspects of a preexisting, already copyrighted work. Also known as a "new version," derivative works can include musical arrangements, motion pictures, art reproductions, sound recordings or translations. They can also include dramatizations and fictionalizations, such as a movie based on a play. [[Source]](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/what-are-derivative-works-under-copyright-law)

##### — What are some examples of derivative works?
* A motion picture based on a play or novel
* A translation of an novel written in English into another language
* A revision of a previously published book
* A sculpture based on a drawing
* A drawing based on a photograph

### Compilations
Compilations differ from derivative works. Rather than an entirely new, original product, compilations are often arrangements or coordinations of prior works and their ability to be copywritten *depends...*

*Here's a definition from the US Copyright Office:  
*(Emphasis mine)
>Compilations of data or compilations of preexisting works (also known as “collective works”) may also be copyrightable if the materials are selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the **resulting work as a whole constitutes a new work**. 
>
>When the collecting of the preexisting material that makes up the compilation is a purely mechanical task with no element of original selection,coordination, or arrangement, such as a white-pages telephone directory, copyright protection for the compilation is not available.

### Who can create derivative works?
Well, anyone *can* create a derivative work, but whether or not you have a *right* to make that derivative is what is at stake here. 

* Copyright owners have the *exclusive* rights to create derivative works. 
* Permissions can be granted to other parties to make derivative works through—you guessed it—licenses!
* This does not apply to cases of **Fair Use** (discussed later)

### How does copyright law treat derivative works?
Just because you gain permission to create a derivative work, does not mean you automatically gain copyright protection. 

In the case of derivative works:

* If you obtain permission to use copyrighted material from the owner (via a license), this *does not* mean you obtain the copyright to the original IP. 
* Likewise, the original copyright of licensed material *does not* extend to your derivative work. i.e. the licensor cannot claim ownership of the licensee's work. 
* Derivative works can obtain their own copyright for original elements, but they *do not* reset the expiration clock on the *original material's copyright*

## Open Source and Public Licenses
Creating individual licenses for each specific use of your IP can a cumbersome process. This bureaucracy also slows down the creative process significantly as obtaining permissions can be a months-long to years-long process. 

One solution is to use a **public license** — essentially a stamp that declares how your work may be used without needing explicit permission for each use. 

One of the most commonly used is [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/). 

*Here some examples of their licenses:*

* **Attribution** — This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. This is the most accommodating of licenses offered. Recommended for maximum dissemination and use of licensed materials.

* **Attribution-NoDerivs** — This license allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as it is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.

* **Attribution-NonCommercial** — This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.

### — Open Source Licenses
Free public licenses are especially important for software and technology creation. Because of the complexities of these technologies, sometimes a more robust public license is needed. 

*These are just two of the most common open-source licenses for open source software:* 

* [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) 
* [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A more robust list can be found on [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses/category).

## Fair Use
*A quick definition:*
>**Fair Use** — Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances. [[source]](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html)

**An important note: Fair Use is not an *automatic right* to use. It is a *defense* that can be used when accused of infringement.**

*Let's watch a video*

*There's also this terribly hard to watch, but entertaining video:* [A Fair(y) Use Tale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJn_jC4FNDo)

### There four factors of fair use:
* The purpose and character of your use.
* The nature of the copyrighted work.
* The amount and substantiality of the portion taken.
* The effect of the use upon the potential market.

Here are a few famous examples of Fair Use cases from [artistrights.info](http://www.artistrights.info/):

* [ROGERS V. KOONS](http://www.artistrights.info/rogers-v-koons/)

* [WOJNAROWICZ V. AMERICAN FAMILY ASSOCIATION](http://www.artistrights.info/wojnarowicz-v-american-family-association)

## THE PUBLIC DOMAIN
*A quick definition:*
>**Public Domain** — the realm embracing property rights that belong to the community at large, are unprotected by copyright or patent, and are subject to appropriation by anyone. [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/public%20domain?utm_campaign=sd&utm_medium=serp&utm_source=jsonld)

### What does it mean when IP enters the Public Domain?
* Intellectual property that belongs to and is available to, the public as a
whole.
* IP enters the public domain when protection terms have expired or the rights have been waived.
* You can use work in the Public Domain without any licenses or prior permission, but there is a [creative commons license avaialable.](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/)
* You cannot claim ownership of items in the public domain! But elements of your derivatives *may* fall under copyright protection.
