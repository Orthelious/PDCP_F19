# Building Blocks
### _A primer on how to form a business and understanding your business relationships with others_

For every business in operation, there are two essential questions that must be answered: who are you and how do you work with others? 

These questions form the basis on which we will build the rest of the course. That's why this unit is titled "Building Blocks." 

We'll start with a primer on basic business structures, from sole proprietorships to corporations—examining the benefits and drawbacks of each—to answer the questions of "Who?". 

Then the focus will shift to agency and employment to help us answer the question "How do we work with others?".

A. [Introduction to business structures and models](#ibsm)  
B. [Common business structures](#cbs)  

## <a name="ibsm">A. Introduction to Business Structures and Models</a>
Understanding exactly *who* you are conducting business with is one of the first steps to empowering yourself in everyday business interactions. 

From collaborators, to customers, to competitors—there are different strategies and methodolgies for success with each. So we need to know *who* we are dealing with.

To start making sense of things, we need to answer two initial questions:

* What ***kind*** of business are we dealing with?
* What does the business ***do***?

Understanding a business's structure and model can help answer these questions. 

### A1 — Business Structures

Understanding how a business is structured helps understand what *kind* of business we are dealing with. 

> *What is a business structure?*

* The framework and/or legal establishment of an entity for conducting business.   

* A business structure defines what the business ***is***, but not necessarily what the business _**does**_.
* A business structure addresses questions like “Who owns the company?”, “How
can I raise money?”, "Who is in control?" and “What taxes do I owe?”
* You will also hear the term business structure used interchangeably with
“Business Entities,” “Organizational Structures,” “Operating Models,”
“Business Licenses,“ and ”Business Types.” They all, generally, mean the same thing as a business structure.

*What do you think are the business structures of the following creative entities?*

* A fine art gallery?	
* A metropolitan museum?	
* A broadway theater?
* A 10-person design firm?
* A music producer?
* A studio artist?


### A2 — Business Models

In its simplest form, a good business model tells us what a business's primary purpose and activites are. We're going to cover business models, and business plans, in-depth in *Unit 7 — Business Models*. 

*But briefly...*  
> *What is a business model?*

* A business model is a design or strategy for how a business should operate.  
 
* A business model describes what resources are needed, how financing and revenue generation should works, defines what is produced and who the customers are, etc. 
* Here are some examples of business models in the for-profit sphere:
	* *[What Is a Business Model? Business Models Explained — Bplans.com](https://articles.bplans.com/what-is-a-business-model-business-models-explained/)*

*Let's look at those creative entities again. What do you think their business models are?*

* A fine art gallery?	
* A metropolitan museum?	
* A broadway theater?
* A 10-person design firm?
* A music producer?
* A studio artist?

## <a name="cbs">B. Common Business Structures</a>

Time to get down to business! (groan. I'll see myself out). 

There are literally hundreds of different combinations of business structures. Too many to delve into in this course. So, we're going to just cover the 6 basic structures that are not only the most common—but are also the structures you will most often interact with in creative practices

*We're going to cover the following common business structures in this chapter:*

1. [Sole Proprietorships](#sole)
2. [Partnerships — General and Limited](#partner)
3. [Corporations — LLC, C Corp, and Non-Profit](#corp)

...*but first*

### // HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN BUSINESS STRUCTURES
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/madmax_tellingapart.gif)

We're going to focus on 5 different factors that every business structure has with **FORCE**.  
*(I wanted a handy anagram, so please keep in mind the following is not in order of importance.)*

* **[F]inance and taxes** — What options does a business have to raise and/or make money? What is the tax burden for the owner(s)?


* **[O]wnership** — Who owns this thing? What does powers and responsibilities ownership come with? 
* **[C]ontrol** — How are decisions made?
* **[R]isk** — Who's assets are at risk? Who is personally responsible?
* **[E]stablishment** — What is the minimum requirement for forming this business structure?

*Wait... the FORCE! I feel a metaphor coming on...*

### <a name="sole">B1 — SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS</a>
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/7MjJvDwdRFbEY/giphy.gif)  
*We open on our hero Finn, alone in the desert. Finally free of the grips of the First Order, he can make his own decisions! But on his own, he also has the most risk...*

What is a **Sole Proprietorship**?

> A Sole Proprietorship is one individual or married couple in business alone. Sole proprietorships are the most common form of business structure. This type of business is simple to form and operate, and may enjoy greater flexibility of management, fewer legal controls, and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

Sole Proprietorships are the default starting point. You engage in some business? Boom! You are automatically a sole proprietorship. You have complete control over your business and the profits, but you also have all of the risks and losses.

*Let's take a look at a Sole Proprietor's FORCE:*  

**Finances and taxes**   
-  Profits are taxed once. It’s all personal income tax.  
-  Profits belong entirely to the owner. But so do the debts...  
-  Ability to raise funds is limited to personal capital, personal gifts and loans.   

**Ownership**  
- Singular owner. You're the boss, buddy.  
- No legal distinction between business and the owner.  
- You cannot transfer ownership.  

**Risk**  
- Sole Proprietorships carry the largest level of risk. Because there is no seperation between the business and the owner, your business assets and personal assets are the same.   
- Unlimited Liability. You and you alone are responsible if anything happens.  

**Control**  
- Singular owner. You're the boss, buddy.  

**Establishment**  
- While there are not neccessarily mandatory requirements to start a Sole Proprietorship, there are best practices like having a business banking account and sometimes you will need industry-specific licenses or permits.

*Which of our creative entities do you think could be a Sole Proprietorship?
 What are some of the advantages? Disadvantages?*
 
* A fine art gallery?	
* A metropolitan museum?	
* A broadway theater?
* A 10-person design firm?
* A music producer?
* A studio artist?

### <a name="partner">B2 — PARTNERSHIPS</a>
Partnerships are just what they sound like: two or more partners. Sharing the burden, sharing the success and sharing the losses. This is the second easiest business structures to form and provides for a great deal of control, but like sole proprietorships comes with  a decent amount of risk. 

We're going to cover two types of partnerships: ***General Partnerships*** and ***Limited partnerships.***

### // GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/56J4bZxxvvOYo/giphy.gif)  
*Oh, look! Our hero Finn has met our other hero Rey! They join forces, making their liklihood of success greater, but also sharing the risk...*

What is a **General Partnership**?
> A General Partnership is composed of 2 or more persons (usually not a married couple) who agree to contribute money, labor, or skill to a business. Each partner shares the profits, losses, and management of the business, and each partner is personally and equally liable for debts of the partnership. Formal terms of the partnership are usually contained in a written partnership agreement. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

**Finances and taxes**  
- Profits pass directly to the partners
- Each partner is responsible for their own personal taxes
- Like Sole Proprietorships, ability to raise funds is limited to personal capital, personal gifts and loans.

**Ownership**  
- Requires two or more people  
- Ownership is automatically a 50/50 split unless spelled out in a partnership agreement. 
- Ownership could transfer to new partners (depending on the partnership agreement.)  

**Risk**  
- Unlimited personal liability for partners.  
- Partners are liable for **each other's actions**!

**Control**  
- The partners are in charge.  
- Control is automatically a 50/50 split unless spelled out in a partnership agreement.  
- There are laws (vary state to state) that govern what a partner is able to do on behalf of the partnership.

**Establishment**   
- Like a Sole Proprietorship, there are not neccessarily mandatory requirements to start.  
- Absolute best practice is to have a written partnership agreement in place! Makes the rules clear!  


### // LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1v1tIRGqi64pO/giphy.gif)  
*Wait, who's that little ball droid?*  

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/PQkvzU96V3BTy/giphy.gif)  
*Why, it's BB-8. It's doing his best to help out, but really it's just following these two because they can fly a ship and get it off-world. Sure, it has something to contribute but really it's a fairly limited partner.*

What is a **Limited Partnership?**
> A Limited Partnership is composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The general partners manage the business and share fully in its profits and losses. Limited partners share in the profits of the business, but their losses are limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are usually not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

**Finances and taxes**  
- Profits are distributed to partners according to a partnership agreement.  
- Taxed once. Taxes pass to individual.  
- General Partners pay self-employment tax (more on this in the Agency and Employment chapters) 

**Ownership**  
- Requires two or more people.  
- There are two types of partners: General Partners (Major) and Limited Partners (Minor).  
- Ownership and transfers are defined by partnership agreement(s).  

**Risk**  
- Unlimited personal liability for the General Partners.  
- **Limited** **liability** for the limited partners. Limited partners may have a limited say in what the business does, but they likewise have limited risk.

**Control**  
- Most often the General Partners are in charge, but Limited Partners do have some say in business operations. A partnership agreement would spell this out.  
- There are laws (vary state to state) governing what a General and/or Limited partner can do.  

**Establishment**  
- Adding a limited partnership has to be done through a written partnership agreement to outline who is a General Partner and who is a Limited Partner.

*Which of our creative entities do you think could work as a partnership?
 Whould they have just general partners? Limited partners?*
 
* A fine art gallery?	
* A metropolitan museum?	
* A broadway theater?
* A 10-person design firm?
* A music producer?
* A studio artist?

### <a name="corp">B3 — CORPORATIONS</a>
*Cue ominious music...*  
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2TcafYEBuy1fG/giphy.gif)

Whereas sole proprietorships and partnerships can be formed instantaneously with a simple agreement, we're now crossing into the world of incorporation. The rest of the business structures we're going to cover have very specific filing and formation requirements.  

What is a **Corporation**?
> A Corporation is a more complex business structure. A corporation has certain rights, privileges, and liabilities beyond those of an individual. Doing business as a corporation may yield tax or financial benefits, but these can be offset by other considerations, such as increased licensing fees or decreased personal control. Corporations may be formed for profit or nonprofit purposes. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

To incorporate is to create a ***seperate entity*** that could exist ***independent of the people who originally founded it.*** (For example: What happened to KFC after Colonel Sanders died?) 

It's all about creating a layer of **seperation** and **protection**.

Incorporation is a legal process that must be done through the government. Unlike a Sole Proprietorship or Partnership, you cannot create an incorporation on your own. [**Articles of Incorporation**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/articlesofincorporation.asp) must be filed. 

We're going to cover the following types of corporate business structures:

* [Limited Liability Company](#llc)
* [C Corporations](#ccorp)
* [Non-Profit Organizations](#non) 

### <a name="llc"> // LLC (LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY)</a>

What is a **Limited Liability Company**?
> A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is formed by 1 or more individuals or entities through a special written agreement. The agreement details the organization of the LLC, including provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. LLCs are permitted to engage in any lawful, for-profit business or activity other than banking or insurance. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2TcafYEBuy1fG/giphy.gif)  
*Ok, this one should be obvious.*

What is a **C Corporation**?
> A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable. [[source]](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure)

What is a **Non-Profit Coroporation**
> Nonprofit corporations are organized to do charity, education, religious, literary, or scientific work. Because their work benefits the public, nonprofits can receive tax-exempt status, meaning they don't pay state or federal taxes income taxes on any profits it makes.

### B4 — BONUS STRUCTURES
The business structures covered above are far and away to most common in US business, but there are many more structures available (though not all are recognized in all 50 states).

*Here are just a few:*

* [B Corps or Benefit Corporations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation)
* [Cooperatives](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/cooperative.html)

For the purposes of this course (and my sanity), we're going to stick to only the most common structures. 

## <a name="ANR">2. Agency and Representation</a>

3. [The Essential Four Components](#four)


*In general, agency and labor boil down to one thing:* 
## <a name=relationships>Relationships</a>

When we talk about agency and labor in this course, we're generally covering the set of rules, guidelines and laws that define the relationship between parties in business. 

It helps us answer the question, "who works for whom?"


As an introduction to this topic, we're going to start things off with  these three primary types of relationships: 

1. **PRINCIPAL AND AGENT**  
	A party who conducts business on behalf of and in the interest of a principal.
	
	*Examples: Lawyers, insurance agents, gallerists*
	
2. **EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE**	
	An agent who works for a principal **AND** whose methods and working
conditions are controlled by the principal.

3. **PRINCIPAL AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR**  
	A party who is **contracted** to do work for a principal, but whose methods and working conditions **are not** controlled by the principal. 

	*Examples: A freelance designer, a general contractor in construction*

This relationships can appear to be straightforward when you're talking about only two or three parties conducting a single piece of business—but few projects are limited to just a few parties. 

***Let's take a look at some examples of projects in creative practices that involve multiple, sometimes complex, relationships:***  

For each of these examples, try to guess how many parties are involved and what their business structures could be. And what are their relationships of these parties to each other?

## <a name="agency">// Defining Agency</a>

The relationships in the prior examples all represent contain some form of an agency relationship. 

###### *— What is agency?*

**AGENCY** — A consensual relationship created by contract or by law where one party, the **principal**, grants authority for another party, the **agent**, to act on behalf of and under the control of the principal to deal with a **third party**.

An agency relationship is **fiduciary** in nature, and the actions and words of an agent exchanged with a third party *bind the principal*.  

###### *— Why is agency important?*

* **Reach** — You can be in two places at once.

* **Augmentation** — You can augment your creative practice utilizing skills and knowledge you don’t personally possess.
 
* **Representation** — You can enable someone who can carry out your wishes and who has has your best interests in mind.
 
* **Employment** — Understanding agency is an essential aspect of being an employee and/or employer.

#### **// Some Helpful Definitions**
* **PRINCIPAL** — The party who authorizes another (an agent) to act on their behalf. A principal could be an individual or a group.

* **AGENT** — The party who is authorized to act on another’s (the principal) behalf. An agent can also be an individual or a group.

* **THIRD PARTY** — Any person or party outside of the two primary parties (principal and agent).

* **FIDUCIARY** — A legal and/or ethical relationship of trust. A person in a fiduciary relationship is obligated to act in the best interest of another.

* **EMPLOYEE** — A person (agent) hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a principal (employer), whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal.

* **INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** — A person hired to perform limited, specific duties for a party according to a contract, for a specific period of time. The independent contractor's work conditions and methods are not strictly controlled by the principal.

#### // The Common Types of Agency

* **General** — Authorized to conduct every kind of business for the Principal.

* **Special** — Authorized to conduct only specific business activities as outlined in a contract.
* **Agent with interest** — The agent possesses interest (owns or controls) some aspects of the Principal’s business.
* **Subagent** — An secondary agent who is agent to both the primary agent and principal.
* **Employee/Employer** — An agent who works for a principal, whose methods and working conditions are controlled by the principal.

*What are some examples we can think of in creative practices?*

## <a name="four">// The Essential Four Components</a>
The are four essential components that help us determine what type and to what extent an agency relationships exists:

1. **FORMATION**
2. **CONTROL**
3. **AUTHORITY**
4. **LIABILITY**

### **// FORMATION**
*How are agency relationships started?*

##### — BY AGREEMENT*

* By express agreement
* Both parties agree to a relationship by verbal or written agreement.
* By implied agreement
* Conduct of both parties expresses an intent to create an agency
relationship

*We will cover agreements in greater details in Unit C

##### — BY RATIFICATION
* A third part sets up the relationship, and the agent and the principal agree.
* Think of this like matchmaking.

##### — BY ESTOPPEL

* A principal's response to a second party's action leads a third party to believe that an agency relationship exists.
	* i.e. If you let someone act for you and go along with it, they can be considered your legal agent.
	* Be careful what you ask someone to do for you.
 
##### — BY OPERATION OF LAW
* Agencies recognized by courts in the absence of a formal agreement.
	* i.e. family relationships, emergency situations

### **// CONTROL**
What level of control does the Principal have over the Agent?

* What is the scope of work or job duties?
* How much direction and control does the principal exercise over the
agent’s work?
* Can the principal determine the agent’s working conditions?
* Is the relationship exclusive?

### **// AUTHORITY**

What is the agent empowered to do?

*Two types:*

* **Actual Authority** — The principal assigns express or implied powers to 
the agent.

* **Apparent Authority** — The principal, knowingly or mistakenly, permits to agent to act with authority they were never expressly granted.
	* This is where agency by estoppel comes in.
	* Essentially, you have to be very clear with your agent on what they can and
cannot do!

### **// LIABILITY**
You could be held responsible for your agent's actions!

* Certan agents are able to enter into legally binding agreements on your behalf.
* You could be held liable for an agent's conduct.
* AHHHHHH!

### — Let's take a look back at our examples from earlier in this lecture. 

### How would you now define the various agency relationships?

## <a name="empemp">The Employer/Employee Relationship</a>

### // Some Context
Why does understanding human resources and labor law matter? Let's look as some local examples*:

* [The Mattress Factory](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2019/01/03/NLRB-closes-Mattress-Factory-investigation-Pittsburgh/stories/201901040026)
* [The Kelly-Strayhorn Theater](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2014/06/28/Former-Kelly-Strayhorn-employee-sues-claims-firing-was-retaliation/stories/201406280034)
* [Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts](https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/12/09/Charlie-Humphrey-resigns-as-executive-director-of-Pittsburgh-Filmmakers-Pittsburgh-Center-for-the-Arts/stories/201512090197)

***DISCLAIMER**: *I was an intern at the Mattress Factory and have worked in different capacities with PF/PCA and KST. By presenting these cases, I am not taking an explicit stance nor am I representing the opinion of this university. I've used these examples as they are well publicized and relevant to our topic.*


### // Defining Employees
**EMPLOYEE** — A person (agent) hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a principal (employer), whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal. 

The Employer/Employee relationship is one of the most common types of agency relationships. The employer (the principal) controls **all** the aspects of the employees job. 

This can include: 

* When the employee is paid and at what rate
* What conditions (i.e. office or shop) they will work in 
* What tasks the employee must perform
* What equipment the employee must use to complete their job

And many more...

***What are some employer/employee experiences from your own life and creative practce?***

### // Setting the Ground Rules
While an employer has a great deal of control over the employee's job, they do not have *unlimited authority*. All employers must adhere to two basic categories of US law when in comes to employment:

* **Labor Law** — The set of laws pertaining to the groups of people. These set of laws regulate unions and collective action. [[source]](http://www.gotnbc.com/Labor%20Law%20101.pdf)
* **Employment Law** — These laws regulate the rights of the individual worker. 

It is *essential* to understand the basics of these laws and practices if you hope to hire and manage employees. In large groups (more than 50) like corporations, adherence to these laws and regulations is usually handled by a Human Resources manager or department. 

*PLEASE NOTE: I am only covering **federal laws.** Each state has their own additional set of laws governing labor practices and regulations.*

## <a name="labor">Labor Law and the Rights of the Group</a>
In general, Labor Law references the area of law that governs how a group of employees must be treated and their right to action. Think of a factory, a farm, a museum, the production of a film—all require the efforts of a *group* of employees to succeed.

This is especially important in creative practices regarding the formation of, and and how to work with, labor unions.

Employment law, generally, deals with the following issues for the individual worker: 

* Discrimination
* Wrongful termination
* Wages and pay equity
* Taxation
* Harassment
* Right to privacy
* Workplace safety

## <a name="ethics">A Note On Employment Ethics</a>
*This portion of the lecture is essentially an op-ed by your instructor. As you create your own collaborations and businesses, I hope you will strongly consider the following ethical suggestions*

### — Be Open to Criticism to Invite Diverse Opinions
Diversity and inclusion should be a top priority for every company. It is my personal opinion that having the greatest variety of experience, cultural and professional background, and perspective builds the greatest framework for success. 

The way to get there is to create a healthy work environment for spirited, professional debate. The way to create a diverse and healthy workplace is to invite *constructive* criticism.  

### — Make the Rules Easy to Find
Employee handbooks are a great thing. Post important policies in the break room. Review your policies annually with your employees. Workplace rules are important, but not everyone will automatically know them and all too often the rules are misinterpreted through rumor and gossip. 

Do the work for your employees and make workplace policies easy to find. 

### — The Rules Should Apply to Everyone
My father, who has an MBA and worked in the corporate telecom world for 40 years, had an essential piece of advice when it came to managing employees: 

> "Just make sure you treat everyone the same." 

Making special cases, bending the rules for personal friends, not establishing clear policies — this is what creates the perfect petri dish for resentment to grow. If you have employees—build the work culture you want—but build it in such a way that policies protect your employees, empowers them, and create a level playing field. 

Avoid a system that awards special favors or exceptions. This is what can lead to a "boys club" atmosphere or contribute to systemic discrimination.  

### — Pay People Equitably. 
Pay people what they're worth. If you can't pay them what they're worth—be honest and upfront as to why *before the work begins*. And make sure that if they are doing the same work as another employee with the same skill level, **that they receive the same pay.**

### — Document! Document! Document!
Anytime you have an issue with an employer or anytime you need to discuss a human resources related issue with an employee—write it down. 

* Keep good records of when you've reprimanded someone. 
* Keep good records of hiring and promotion processes.
* Keep good records of what someone's job duties are.
* Keep good records of annual performance reviews and evaluations.
* Keep good records when you fire someone.

KEEP GOOD RECORDS, Y'ALL. 

### — Deal with Problems Immediately and Seek Professional Advice
Think of the last time you brought up an issue to your boss. I'm going to venture a guess that the longer it took for them to address it, the more it felt like they weren't taking you seriously. 

Deal with problems immediately. If you don't know what to do, seek professional advice from a human resources professional or an employment law attorney. 

### — Internships
Ah... internships. It is my opinion that internships (unless you're receiving course credit) should be paid positions. If you want to volunteer your time and your skills for no pay—my advice is to get as much of an educational experience as possible. But if you're just fetching coffee for the boss and sitting at a front desk twiddling your thumbs—that is a job and you should be paid. 

## <a name="add">// Addendum</a>
*This addendum includes a question from a student that the instructor had to research and report back to the class.*

> "When employers discourage sharing wages, how does that function legally? I know there’s a degree of cultural stigma to keep in mind around asking people (coworkers or not) about their wages, but is there any factor of that that employers can enforce legally speaking, or any specific legal frameworks that employees or job applicants can use to work around and figure out what employees are actually making?"

In short, the answer is that employees are protected in *most cases* to share their wage and salary information with each other. 

This falls under the category of organizing and collective bargaining protected by the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov) under the National Labor Relations Act. I think this article on GovDocs gives the most concise and clear explanation I've found: 

* [Can Employees Discuss Pay and Salaries?](https://www.govdocs.com/can-employees-discuss-pay-salaries/) · GovDocs
 
*There are some exceptions and items to note:*

* There are some types of government and organizations that do not fall under the NLRB protections. (The GovDocs article provides an explanation as to why). 
* You are broadly protected to *freely discuss* salary or wage as part of organizing activity, but you *cannot force* your co-worker to reveal their salary. This would violate their privacy rights and also is just a real jerk move. 
* Additionally, if you handle payroll or finances for your organization:

	> An employee whose job function involves access to company wage and payroll information may not disclose employee pay information to other employees unless directed to by the employer or an investigating agency. [GovDocs]

So, in most cases, an employer cannot create a company policy prohibiting employees from discussing pay. Importantly, this also applies to discussing **working conditions**—here's an example from the NLRB website: [Protected Concerted Activity.

# <a name="self">4. Self-Employment and Independent Contracting</a>

This is a brief topic. The goal here is to draw a distinction between a traditional employee and an independent contractor. 

Not understanding this distinction can be one of the primary ways creative practitioners are taken advantage of. 

## EMPLOYEE VS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

### // Let's first define the two:

**EMPLOYEE** — A person hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a entity, whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal.

*As we’ve discussed in A.2, the employer/employee relationship is a type of agency relationship.*

* The employee (agent) is controlled totally by the employer (principal)
* This relationship is additionally governed by labor and employment law.

**INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR**— A person hired to perform limited, specific duties for a party according to a contract, for a specific period of time. Their work conditions and methods are not strictly controlled by the principal, but by the terms of the contract.

An independent contractor is not (automatically) an agent in their relationship to the principal. 

* The key here is “independent”
* This relationship is governed by the contract between the two parties and standards of contract law.

### // How Do You Tell the Difference?
It's not just whether or not a principal *calls* you an employee or an independent contractor. The relationship has to be defined and follow a set of standards set out in US law. 

The IRS gives us at least these three top-level tests to determined whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor:


1. **Behavioral**: Does the company control or have the right to control what the worker does and how the worker does his or her job?
	* If the principal is supplying the office, the equipment, sets your hours, etc — you are most likely an employee. 
	* If you operate independently of the principal and determine for yourself how the job will get completed—you are likely a contractor. 
	
	
2.  **Financial**: Are the business aspects of the worker’s job controlled by the payer? (these include things like how worker is paid, whether expenses are reimbursed, who provides tools/supplies, etc.)

	* How, when and in what manner you are paid for a job is a major determining factor. We're going to cover this in a greater level of detail in Unit E.

3. **Type of Relationship**: Are there written contracts or employee type benefits (i.e. pension plan, insurance, vacation pay, etc.)? 
	* If you are receiving employee-type benefits, you are likely an employee. 
	* If you do not receive *employee-type benefits*, you are likely an contractor. 
	* Additionally, the contract between you and the principal should expressly state as much. We will cover more of this in Unit C. 

	Will the relationship continue
and is the work performed a key aspect of the business?
	
	* If yes, then you are likely an **employee**
	* If no and the relationship or key aspect of business has a *set end date* — you are a **contractor**.
