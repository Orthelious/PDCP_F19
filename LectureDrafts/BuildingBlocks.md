Understanding exactly *who* you are conducting business with is one of the first steps to empowering yourself in everyday business interactions.

To start making sense of things, we need to answer two initial questions:

* What ***kind*** of business are we dealing with?
* What does the business ***do***?

#### — Business Structures
What ***kind*** of business are we dealing with?

Understanding how a business is structured helps understand what *kind* of business we are dealing with. 

###### // *What is a business structure?*

* The framework and/or legal establishment of an entity for conducting business.
* A business structure defines what the business is, but not necessarily what the
business does.
* A business structure answers questions like “Who owns the company?”, “How
can I raise money?” and “What taxes do I owe?”
* You will also hear the term business structure used interchangeably with
“Business Entities,” “Organizational Structures,” “Operating Models,”
“Business Licenses,“ and ”Business Types.”

###### // *What are some examples from creative practices?*

#### — Business Models
> What does the business ***do***?

In its simplest form, a good business model literally tells us what a business's primary purpose and direction is. We're going to cover business models, and business plans, in-depth in *Unit E — Business Planning*. 


*What is a business model?*

* A design or strategy for how a business should operate. 
* A business model describes what resources that are needed, how financing works, who the customers are, the likely sources of revenue, who the customers are, etc. 
* Here are some examples of business models in the for-profit sphere:
	* *[What Is a Business Model? Business Models Explained](https://articles.bplans.com/what-is-a-business-model-business-models-explained/)*

### <a name="cbs">B. Common Business Structures</a>  

Time to get down to business! (groan. I'll see myself out). 

*We're going to cover the following common business structures in this unit:*

1. [Sole Proprietorships](#sole)
2. [Partnerships](#partner)
3. [Corporations](#corp)

...*but first*

#### — HOW TO DIFFERENTIATE BUSINESS STRUCTURES
![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/madmax_tellingapart.gif)

We're going to focus on 5 different factors that every business structure has with **FORCE**. (I wanted a handy anagram, so please keep in mind the following is not in order of importance.)

* **[F]inance and taxes** — How can a business raise and/or make money? What is the tax burden for the owner(s)?
* **[O]wnership** — Who owns this thing? What does ownership come with? 
* **[C]ontrol** — How are decisions made?
* **[R]isk** — Who's assets are at risk? Who is personally responsible?
* **[E]stablishment** — What is the minimum requirement for forming this business structure?

Wait... the FORCE! I feel a metaphor coming on...

### <a name="sole">// 1. SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS</a>
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/7MjJvDwdRFbEY/giphy.gif)  
*Our hero Finn, alone in the desert. Finally free of the grips of the First Order, he can make his own decisions! But on his own, he also has the most risk...*

> A Sole Proprietorship is one individual or married couple in business alone. Sole proprietorships are the most common form of business structure. This type of business is simple to form and operate, and may enjoy greater flexibility of management, fewer legal controls, and fewer taxes. However, the business owner is personally liable for all debts incurred by the business. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

Sole Proprietorships are the default starting point. You engage in some business? Boom! You are automatically a sole proprietorship. You have complete control over your business and the profits, but you also have all of the risks and losses.

Let's take a look at a Sole Proprietor's FORCE:

* **Finances and taxes** — 


* OWNERSHIP:
	* Singular owner.
	* No legal distinction between business and the owner. 
	* No ownership transfer.
* FORMATION: 
	* No requirements, but there are best practices like having a
business banking account and sometimes you need industry-specific licenses
or permits.
* LIABILITY: 
	* Unlimited personal liability. 
	* Business assets and personal assets are the same. 

* TAXATION: 
	* Profits are taxed once. It’s all personal income tax.
* MANAGEMENT: 
	* You’re your own boss, buddy.
* FUNDRAISING ABILITY: 
	* Very limited to none. Pretty much limited to
personal capital. Banks are wary of sole proprietorship because of liability.

*Let's take a look at our chart*

### <a name="partner">// 2. PARTNERSHIPS</a>
We're going to cover two types of partnerships: ***General*** and ***Limited.***

#### **— GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS**
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/56J4bZxxvvOYo/giphy.gif)
> A General Partnership is composed of 2 or more persons (usually not a married couple) who agree to contribute money, labor, or skill to a business. Each partner shares the profits, losses, and management of the business, and each partner is personally and equally liable for debts of the partnership. Formal terms of the partnership are usually contained in a written partnership agreement. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)

* **OWNERSHIP**
	* Two or more people
	* Ownership can transfer to new partners (depends on partnership
agreement.)
* **FORMATION** 
	* No real requirements, but should be created by a partnership
agreement.
* **LIABILITY**
	* Unlimited personal liability for partners.
	* Partners are liable for each other!
* **TAXATION**
	* Profits are evenly distributed to partners.
	* Taxed once. Taxes pass to individual.
* **MANAGEMENT**
	* The partners are in charge.
	* A partnership agreement would spell this out.
	* There are some laws governing what a partner can do.
* **FUNDRAISING ABILITY**
	* Very limited to none.
	* Partners contribute personal capital.

![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/BusiStruct_2.png)

#### **— LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS**
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/1v1tIRGqi64pO/giphy.gif)
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/PQkvzU96V3BTy/giphy.gif)
> A Limited Partnership is composed of one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The general partners manage the business and share fully in its profits and losses. Limited partners share in the profits of the business, but their losses are limited to the extent of their investment. Limited partners are usually not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


* **OWNERSHIP**
	* Two or more people.
	* There are General Partners (Major) and Limited Partners (Minor).
	* Ownership and transfers are defined by partnership agreement.
* **FORMATION**
	* Created by a partnership agreement.
* **LIABILITY**
	* Unlimited personal liability for the General Partners.
	* Limited liability for the limited partners.
* **TAXATION**
	* Profits are distributed to partners according to partnership agreement.
	* Taxed once. Taxes pass to individual.
	* General Partners pay self-employment tax.
* **MANAGEMENT**
	* Often the General Partners are in charge, but Limited Partners have a say.
	* A partnership agreement would spell this out.
	* There are some laws governing what a partner can do.
* **FUNDRAISING ABILITY**
	* Very limited to none.
	* Partners contribute personal capital.

### <a name="corp">// 3. CORPORATIONS!</a>
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2TcafYEBuy1fG/giphy.gif)

Whereas sole proprietorships and partnerships can be formed instantaneously with a simple agreement, we're now crossing into the world of incorporation. The rest of the business structures we're going to cover have very specific filing and formation requirements.  

> A Corporation is a more complex business structure. A corporation has certain rights, privileges, and liabilities beyond those of an individual. Doing business as a corporation may yield tax or financial benefits, but these can be offset by other considerations, such as increased licensing fees or decreased personal control. Corporations may be formed for profit or nonprofit purposes. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


We're going to cover the following types of corporate structures:

* Limited Liability Corporations
* C Corporations
* S Corporations
* Non-Profit Organizations 

#### **— LLC (LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY)**
> A Limited Liability Company (LLC) is formed by 1 or more individuals or entities through a special written agreement. The agreement details the organization of the LLC, including provisions for management, assignability of interests, and distribution of profits and losses. LLCs are permitted to engage in any lawful, for-profit business or activity other than banking or insurance. [[source]](https://bls.dor.wa.gov/ownershipstructures.aspx)


* **OWNERSHIP**
	* One or more people.
	* Transfer of ownership possible.
	* Combines elements of Corporations and Sole Proprietorships/Partnerships.
* **FORMATION**
	* File Articles of Incorporation with the state government.
* **LIABILITY**
	* LIMITED!!
	* Personal assets are considered separate from business assets.
	* LLC’s are popular because of the protections and flexibility they offer.
* **TAXATION**
	* Taxed once. Taxes pass to individual.
	* Individuals pay self-employment tax if employed.
	* Whole bunch of other tax options available.
* **MANAGEMENT**
	* Members or appointed officers (It’s flexible.)
	* Defined by an Operating Agreements (Best practice.)
* **FUNDRAISING ABILITY**
	* Can sell interest (ownership) in the company.  

![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/BusiStruct_4.png)

#### **— C CORPORATIONS**
> A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable. [[source]](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure)

* **OWNERSHIP**
	* One or more people.
	* Transfer of ownership possible.
* **FORMATION**
	* File Articles of Incorporation + Bylaws with the state government.
* **LIABILITY**
	* The most limited.
	* Personal assets are considered separate from business assets.
	* C Corp’s are popular to investors because of these protections.
* **TAXATION**
	* Taxed TWICE.

	* Can sell stock in the company.
	* Considered the most attractive for investors.

![](https://github.com/Orthelious/PDCP_Spring2019/blob/master/images/BusiStruct_5.png)

#### **— S CORPORATIONS**
> An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates. [[source]](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure)

* **OWNERSHIP**
	* One or more people. But limited to 100 shareholders.
	* Transfer of ownership possible.

#### **— NON-PROFIT CORPORATIONS — 501(C)3**
> Nonprofit corporations are organized to do charity, education, religious, literary, or scientific work. Because their work benefits the public, nonprofits can receive tax-exempt status, meaning they don't pay state or federal taxes income taxes on any profits it makes. [[source]](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/launch-your-business/choose-business-structure)

* **OWNERSHIP**
	* One or more people + a board of directors.
	* Technically not owned in the traditional sense. Non-profits are considered public charities
and are intended to have lives beyond their founders.
* **FORMATION**
	* File Articles of Incorporation + Bylaws with the state government.
	* Plus additional filing with the IRS. This is where the 501(c)3 comes from.
	* You need a minimum of three board members!

For the purposes of this course (and my sanity), we're going to stick to only the most common structures. 

## <a name="ANR">2. Agency and Representation</a>
*Three sections to this lecture:*

1. [Relationships](#relationships)
2. [Defining Agency](#agency)
3. [The Essential Four Components](#four)


*In general, agency and labor boil down to one thing:* 
## <a name=relationships>Relationships</a>

When we talk about agency and labor in this course, we're generally covering the set of rules, guidelines and laws that define the relationship between parties in business. 

It helps us answer the question, "who works for whom?"


As an introduction to this topic, we're going to start things off with  these three primary types of relationships: 

1. **PRINCIPAL AND AGENT**  
	A party who conducts business on behalf of and in the interest of a principal.
	
	*Examples: Lawyers, insurance agents, gallerists*
	
2. **EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE**	
	An agent who works for a principal **AND** whose methods and working
conditions are controlled by the principal.

3. **PRINCIPAL AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR**  
	A party who is **contracted** to do work for a principal, but whose methods and working conditions **are not** controlled by the principal. 

	*Examples: A freelance designer, a general contractor in construction*

This relationships can appear to be straightforward when you're talking about only two or three parties conducting a single piece of business—but few projects are limited to just a few parties. 

***Let's take a look at some examples of projects in creative practices that involve multiple, sometimes complex, relationships:***  

For each of these examples, try to guess how many parties are involved and what their business structures could be. And what are their relationships of these parties to each other?

## <a name="agency">// Defining Agency</a>

The relationships in the prior examples all represent contain some form of an agency relationship. 

###### *— What is agency?*

**AGENCY** — A consensual relationship created by contract or by law where one party, the **principal**, grants authority for another party, the **agent**, to act on behalf of and under the control of the principal to deal with a **third party**.

An agency relationship is **fiduciary** in nature, and the actions and words of an agent exchanged with a third party *bind the principal*.  

###### *— Why is agency important?*

* **Reach** — You can be in two places at once.

* **Augmentation** — You can augment your creative practice utilizing skills and knowledge you don’t personally possess.
 
* **Representation** — You can enable someone who can carry out your wishes and who has has your best interests in mind.
 
* **Employment** — Understanding agency is an essential aspect of being an employee and/or employer.

#### **// Some Helpful Definitions**
* **PRINCIPAL** — The party who authorizes another (an agent) to act on their behalf. A principal could be an individual or a group.

* **AGENT** — The party who is authorized to act on another’s (the principal) behalf. An agent can also be an individual or a group.

* **THIRD PARTY** — Any person or party outside of the two primary parties (principal and agent).

* **FIDUCIARY** — A legal and/or ethical relationship of trust. A person in a fiduciary relationship is obligated to act in the best interest of another.

* **EMPLOYEE** — A person (agent) hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a principal (employer), whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal.

* **INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR** — A person hired to perform limited, specific duties for a party according to a contract, for a specific period of time. The independent contractor's work conditions and methods are not strictly controlled by the principal.

#### // The Common Types of Agency

* **General** — Authorized to conduct every kind of business for the Principal.

* **Special** — Authorized to conduct only specific business activities as outlined in a contract.
* **Agent with interest** — The agent possesses interest (owns or controls) some aspects of the Principal’s business.
* **Subagent** — An secondary agent who is agent to both the primary agent and principal.
* **Employee/Employer** — An agent who works for a principal, whose methods and working conditions are controlled by the principal.

*What are some examples we can think of in creative practices?*

## <a name="four">// The Essential Four Components</a>
The are four essential components that help us determine what type and to what extent an agency relationships exists:

1. **FORMATION**
2. **CONTROL**
3. **AUTHORITY**
4. **LIABILITY**

### **// FORMATION**
*How are agency relationships started?*

##### — BY AGREEMENT*

* By express agreement
* Both parties agree to a relationship by verbal or written agreement.
* By implied agreement
* Conduct of both parties expresses an intent to create an agency
relationship

*We will cover agreements in greater details in Unit C

##### — BY RATIFICATION
* A third part sets up the relationship, and the agent and the principal agree.
* Think of this like matchmaking.

##### — BY ESTOPPEL

* A principal's response to a second party's action leads a third party to believe that an agency relationship exists.
	* i.e. If you let someone act for you and go along with it, they can be considered your legal agent.
	* Be careful what you ask someone to do for you.
 
##### — BY OPERATION OF LAW
* Agencies recognized by courts in the absence of a formal agreement.
	* i.e. family relationships, emergency situations

### **// CONTROL**
What level of control does the Principal have over the Agent?

* What is the scope of work or job duties?
* How much direction and control does the principal exercise over the
agent’s work?
* Can the principal determine the agent’s working conditions?
* Is the relationship exclusive?

### **// AUTHORITY**

What is the agent empowered to do?

*Two types:*

* **Actual Authority** — The principal assigns express or implied powers to 
the agent.

* **Apparent Authority** — The principal, knowingly or mistakenly, permits to agent to act with authority they were never expressly granted.
	* This is where agency by estoppel comes in.
	* Essentially, you have to be very clear with your agent on what they can and
cannot do!

### **// LIABILITY**
You could be held responsible for your agent's actions!

* Certan agents are able to enter into legally binding agreements on your behalf.
* You could be held liable for an agent's conduct.
* AHHHHHH!

***

### — Let's take a look back at our examples from earlier in this lecture. 

### How would you now define the various agency relationships?

## <a name="empemp">The Employer/Employee Relationship</a>

### // Some Context
Why does understanding human resources and labor law matter? Let's look as some local examples*:

* [The Mattress Factory](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2019/01/03/NLRB-closes-Mattress-Factory-investigation-Pittsburgh/stories/201901040026)
* [The Kelly-Strayhorn Theater](https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2014/06/28/Former-Kelly-Strayhorn-employee-sues-claims-firing-was-retaliation/stories/201406280034)
* [Pittsburgh Filmmakers/Pittsburgh Center for the Arts](https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2015/12/09/Charlie-Humphrey-resigns-as-executive-director-of-Pittsburgh-Filmmakers-Pittsburgh-Center-for-the-Arts/stories/201512090197)

***DISCLAIMER**: *I was an intern at the Mattress Factory and have worked in different capacities with PF/PCA and KST. By presenting these cases, I am not taking an explicit stance nor am I representing the opinion of this university. I've used these examples as they are well publicized and relevant to our topic.*


### // Defining Employees
**EMPLOYEE** — A person (agent) hired to perform duties on an ongoing basis for a principal (employer), whose work conditions and methods are strictly controlled by the principal. 

The Employer/Employee relationship is one of the most common types of agency relationships. The employer (the principal) controls **all** the aspects of the employees job. 

This can include: 

* When the employee is paid and at what rate
* What conditions (i.e. office or shop) they will work in 
* What tasks the employee must perform
* What equipment the employee must use to complete their job

And many more...

***What are some employer/employee experiences from your own life and creative practce?***

### // Setting the Ground Rules
While an employer has a great deal of control over the employee's job, they do not have *unlimited authority*. All employers must adhere to two basic categories of US law when in comes to employment:

* **Labor Law** — The set of laws pertaining to the groups of people. These set of laws regulate unions and collective action. [[source]](http://www.gotnbc.com/Labor%20Law%20101.pdf)
* **Employment Law** — These laws regulate the rights of the individual worker. 

It is *essential* to understand the basics of these laws and practices if you hope to hire and manage employees. In large groups (more than 50) like corporations, adherence to these laws and regulations is usually handled by a Human Resources manager or department. 

*PLEASE NOTE: I am only covering **federal laws.** Each state has their own additional set of laws governing labor practices and regulations.*

## <a name="labor">Labor Law and the Rights of the Group</a>
In general, Labor Law references the area of law that governs how a group of employees must be treated and their right to action. Think of a factory, a farm, a museum, the production of a film—all require the efforts of a *group* of employees to succeed.

This is especially important in creative practices regarding the formation of, and and how to work with, labor unions. 

*Some helpful definitions:*

* **Labor Union** — an organization of workers formed for the purpose of advancing its members' interests in respect to wages, benefits, and working conditions. [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/labor%20union)
* **Collective Bargaining** — negotiation between an employer and a labor union usually on wages, hours, and working conditions. [[source]](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collective%20bargaining)

### **// Labor Laws and Regulations to be Aware of:**
#### *— Fair Labor Standards Act*
*A federal law passed in 1938 that establishes a few key practices and regulations*

* The right to a minimum wage
* The right to overtime pay when exceeding a 40-hour work week
* Prohibits most employment of minors

*There are MANY additional acts that build on this law, further detailing the rights of the collective workforce. You can check out an abbreviated list here on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Labor_Standards_Act_of_1938)*

#### *— National Labor Relations Act*

Established in 1935, this act effectively enshrines the rights of workers to form labor unions (and other types of organizing activities) and collectively bargain to improve working conditions and wages. 


## <a name="emplaw">Employment Law and the Rights of the Individual</a>
A complement to Labor Law, we have employment law, which defines the rights of an individual worker *and job applicants.* 

Employment law, generally, deals with the following issues for the individual worker: 

* Discrimination
* Wrongful termination
* Wages and pay equity
* Taxation
* Harassment
* Right to privacy
* Workplace safety
* 'Whistleblower' rights
* Leave policies

Here are a few starting points, specifically from the creative practitioner point of view, for reading more about issues of wages and labor:

## <a name="ethics">A Note On Employment Ethics</a>
*This portion of the lecture is essentially an op-ed by your instructor. As you create your own collaborations and businesses, I hope you will strongly consider the following ethical suggestions*

### — Be Open to Criticism to Invite Diverse Opinions
Diversity and inclusion should be a top priority for every company. It is my personal opinion that having the greatest variety of experience, cultural and professional background, and perspective builds the greatest framework for success. 

The way to get there is to create a healthy work environment for spirited, professional debate. The way to create a diverse and healthy workplace is to invite *constructive* criticism.  

### — Make the Rules Easy to Find
Employee handbooks are a great thing. Post important policies in the break room. Review your policies annually with your employees. Workplace rules are important, but not everyone will automatically know them and all too often the rules are misinterpreted through rumor and gossip. 

Do the work for your employees and make workplace policies easy to find. 

### — The Rules Should Apply to Everyone
My father, who has an MBA and worked in the corporate telecom world for 40 years, had an essential piece of advice when it came to managing employees: 

> "Just make sure you treat everyone the same." 

Making special cases, bending the rules for personal friends, not establishing clear policies — this is what creates the perfect petri dish for resentment to grow. If you have employees—build the work culture you want—but build it in such a way that policies protect your employees, empowers them, and create a level playing field. 

Avoid a system that awards special favors or exceptions. This is what can lead to a "boys club" atmosphere or contribute to systemic discrimination.  

### — Pay People Equitably. 
Pay people what they're worth. If you can't pay them what they're worth—be honest and upfront as to why *before the work begins*. And make sure that if they are doing the same work as another employee with the same skill level, **that they receive the same pay.**

### — Document! Document! Document!
Anytime you have an issue with an employer or anytime you need to discuss a human resources related issue with an employee—write it down. 

* Keep good records of when you've reprimanded someone. 
* Keep good records of hiring and promotion processes.
* Keep good records of what someone's job duties are.
* Keep good records of annual performance reviews and evaluations.
* Keep good records when you fire someone.

KEEP GOOD RECORDS, Y'ALL. 

### — Deal with Problems Immediately and Seek Professional Advice
Think of the last time you brought up an issue to your boss. I'm going to venture a guess that the longer it took for them to address it, the more it felt like they weren't taking you seriously. 

Deal with problems immediately. If you don't know what to do, seek professional advice from a human resources professional or an employment law attorney. 

### — Internships
Ah... internships. It is my opinion that internships (unless you're receiving course credit) should be paid positions. If you want to volunteer your time and your skills for no pay—my advice is to get as much of an educational experience as possible. But if you're just fetching coffee for the boss and sitting at a front desk twiddling your thumbs—that is a job and you should be paid. 

## <a name="add">// Addendum</a>
*This addendum includes a question from a student that the instructor had to research and report back to the class.*

> "When employers discourage sharing wages, how does that function legally? I know there’s a degree of cultural stigma to keep in mind around asking people (coworkers or not) about their wages, but is there any factor of that that employers can enforce legally speaking, or any specific legal frameworks that employees or job applicants can use to work around and figure out what employees are actually making?"

In short, the answer is that employees are protected in *most cases* to share their wage and salary information with each other. 

This falls under the category of organizing and collective bargaining protected by the [National Labor Relations Board](https://www.nlrb.gov) under the National Labor Relations Act. I think this article on GovDocs gives the most concise and clear explanation I've found: 

* [Can Employees Discuss Pay and Salaries?](https://www.govdocs.com/can-employees-discuss-pay-salaries/) · GovDocs
 
*There are some exceptions and items to note:*

* There are some types of government and organizations that do not fall under the NLRB protections. (The GovDocs article provides an explanation as to why). 
* You are broadly protected to *freely discuss* salary or wage as part of organizing activity, but you *cannot force* your co-worker to reveal their salary. This would violate their privacy rights and also is just a real jerk move. 
* Additionally, if you handle payroll or finances for your organization:

	> An employee whose job function involves access to company wage and payroll information may not disclose employee pay information to other employees unless directed to by the employer or an investigating agency. [GovDocs]

So, in most cases, an employer cannot create a company policy prohibiting employees from discussing pay. Importantly, this also applies to discussing **working conditions**—here's an example from the NLRB website: [Protected Concerted Activity.
