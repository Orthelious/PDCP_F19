## Course Description
This course is intended to expose students studying in creative fields to the basic principles, skills and functions of business used every day in creative practices and industries. Supporting a creative practice - whether an individual studio practice, a temporary collaboration or commission, or an incorporated business or non-profit - all require a foundational knowledge of basic organizational, legal, and financial structures and practices.

Throughout this seminar-style course, students can expect to develop a starting knowledge of basic business concepts; learn a foundational understanding of ethics and best practices in business; develop problem-solving skill sets and methodologies for managing creative projects and programs; and practice applying these learnings to their own creative practices. Topics covered will include, but are not limited to: basic business structures; intellectual property; contracts and employment; methods for generating income and fundraising; financial management and taxes; marketing and communications; negotiation and compromise; and elements of business strategy development.
